# RecommendingPlantSpecies
The goal of this project is when we have past data about the different environments, locations and aspects related to the growth of different plant types we should be able to predict the plant type that can be grown given the location, aspect etc. The target feature or the dependent feature is the PlantType and it has seven different classes. Hence this is a multi class classification problem. </br>
This repo contains the data and the ipynb file which has all the necessary steps involved in the Data analysis, cleaning the data set, pre proceessing, feature engineering along with building models with hyper parameter tuning and comaprision of KPIS.
Please go through the document to understand each section.</br>
The data was used from Maverick.io challenges.
